Personal Profile Statement
-
**Computer science** sophomore, highly motivated to practically apply obtained theoretical knowledge in Advanced Mathematics and Programming at position of **Data Scientist/ML Engineer**. In my current studies, I participated in projects on model-view-controller database app and credit scoring app; side internship on credit scoring and data collection script.  

Skills
-
* Python (Level 3 Algorithms&Data Structures):  
— numpy, pandas, scikit-learn — active user;  
— xgboost, lgbm, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly — occasional user with documentation;  
— tensorflow keras, pytorch, nltk, bigquery — beginner.  

* MacOS zsh, Linux VM bash — daily usage, basic scripts. 
* Conda venvs, Docker Containerization — satisfactory for Python projects.

* C — along with Computer Architecture and Operating Systems course:  
— static/dynamic libraries;  
— synchronisation, interprocess communication;  
— users, groups, permissions.  

* HTML (basic understanding; mainly used for Python projects). 
* C++ (Level 2.5 in ADS I'd say: overall competence and lack of understanding of some language-specific aspects):  
— stdlib;  
— Qt Framework (cross-platform apps).  

* Assembly (RISCV-32).

* Markdown — current CV is written in it.

* Russian (native), English (IELTS 7.5 ~ CEFR C1), French (CEFR A1).
